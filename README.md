# IonnsaichSeo
Learn Scottish Gaelic through repetition.

INSTRUCTIONS
First download the Vocabulary folder (containing CSV files) and place it in a designated folder along with the .py files. For example:
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/index.py
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/is_numbers.py
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/Vocabulary/animals_pets.csv
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/Vocabulary/food_fruit.csv
... and so on.
To run the application, run index.py using Python. Make sure your IDE has set the working folder to be the one in which index.py is located.
You will first pick the lesson you want to run, and then pick the main vocabulary list to use for that lesson. 

WARNING: Not all vocabulary lists are suitable for all programs. Soon I'll make sure the application checks the suitability of a vocabulary list when the user tries to select it. For now, generally make sure the vocab list has headers "english" and "nom_sing", and if you're practicing plurals then it also needs "nom_pl".
