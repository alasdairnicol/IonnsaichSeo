# IonnsaichSeo
Learn Scottish Gaelic through repetition.

INSTRUCTIONS
First download the Vocabulary folder (containing CSV files) and place it in a designated folder along with the .py files. For example:
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/__main__.py
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/is_numbers.py
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/Vocabulary/animals_pets.csv
C:/My Documents/Ionnsaich Seo/Vocabulary/food_fruit.csv
... and so on.

To run the application, run index.py using Python. Make sure your IDE has set the working folder to be the one in which __main__.py is located.

You will first pick the lesson you want to run, and then pick the main vocabulary list to use for that lesson.
