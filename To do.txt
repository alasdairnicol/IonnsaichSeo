Q: Why is "to be" (either one) not an irregular verb??

Overall app:
 - Create utility modules which contain:
   - grammatical things (lenition, indefinite articles, definite articles, etc)
 - Put vocab list checks into utilities functions
 - add recommended/suggested vocab lists - automate??

Improvements for each generated question set:
 - Make the code check the suitability of the chosen vocab list.
 - Make the vocab/grammar files global so they aren't read in every time a question is generated

- it does not ignore apostrophes and hyphens
- you have to specify singular or plural when translating "you" into English

Vocab files:
