Q: Why is "to be" (either one) not an irregular verb??

Overall app:
 - Create utility modules which contain:
   - grammatical things (lenition, indefinite articles, definite articles, etc)
 - Put vocab list checks into utilities functions
 - add recommended/suggested vocab lists - automate??

Improvements for each generated question set:
 - Make the code check the suitability of the chosen vocab list.
 - Make the vocab/grammar files global so they aren't read in every time a question is generated

Adjectives, verbs: short and long version? (Small sample vs whole list)

Additional modules:
 - verbs & tense (irreg)
 - possessive article (mo/do/...) - family, body parts, clothes
 - emphatic pronouns and adjectives
   ... need to create adjective file, and finish q/sol/prompt. 
 - places in Scotland and... "I am from"? "I live in"? "I am going to"? etc?

Vocab:
 - add vocative to names list

Strengths & Limitations of code:
+ it ignores capitalisation in user answers
+ it ignores leading and trailing spaces in user answers
- it does not ignore accents
- it does not ignore apostrophes and hyphens
- you have to specify singular or plural when translating "you" into English

Vocab files:
 - checking them for columns
 - listing suitable vocab files for modules

Regular verbs:
 - improve question format
