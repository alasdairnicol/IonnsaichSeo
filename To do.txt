Q: Why is "to be" (either one) not an irregular verb??

Overall app:
Work out how to turn this into an app
Create utility modules which contain:
 grammatical things (lenition, indefinite articles, definite articles, etc)
Put a bit more documentation in the code
Put vocab list checks into utilities functions
add recommended/suggested vocab lists - automate??

Improvements for each generated question set:
Make the code check the suitability of the chosen vocab list.

Additional modules:
verbs & tense (regular & irreg)
possessive article (mo/do/...) - family, body parts, clothes
I like / would like / prefer / would prefer (& negative)

Vocab:
add vocative to names list

Strengths & Limitations of code:
+ it ignores capitalisation in user answers
+ it ignores leading and trailing spaces in user answers
- it does not ignore accents
- it does not ignore apostrophes and hyphens
