Q: Why is "to be" (either one) not an irregular verb??

Overall app:
 - Create utility modules which contain:
   - grammatical things (lenition, indefinite articles, definite articles, etc)
 - Put vocab list checks into utilities functions
 - add recommended/suggested vocab lists - automate??

Improvements for each generated question set:
 - Make the code check the suitability of the chosen vocab list.

Additional modules:
 - verbs & tense (regular & irreg)
 - possessive article (mo/do/...) - family, body parts, clothes

Vocab:
 - add vocative to names list

Strengths & Limitations of code:
+ it ignores capitalisation in user answers
+ it ignores leading and trailing spaces in user answers
- it does not ignore accents
- it does not ignore apostrophes and hyphens
- you have to specify singular or plural when translating "you" into English
